Project Overview
This project is part of the NTI (National Telecommunication Institute) Machine Learning training track.
The goal is to apply multiple classification algorithms to real-world data and compare their performance.
 Objective
To build and evaluate different machine learning models that can classify data accurately.
We used various algorithms to determine which model gives the best results on the dataset provided.


Models Implemented
Each model is in a separate .ipynb notebook:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost
LightGBM
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
Neural Network

Tools Used
Python
Google Colab
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
XGBoost / LightGBM
Keras (for Neural Network)

Evaluation
We evaluated models using accuracy and performance metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The results were visualized using plots to make comparison easier.

 Notes
The notebooks were developed and tested using Google Colab.
Data files must be uploaded before running the notebooks.
Images and presentation files are included for reference.
